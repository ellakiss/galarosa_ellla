            <h2>Introduction to Teenage Pregnancy</h2>
            <p>Teenage pregnancy refers to pregnancies that occur in individuals under the age of 20. It's a significant public health concern globally, impacting the lives of millions of adolescents and their families every year. Despite efforts to reduce its prevalence, teenage pregnancy remains a complex issue influenced by various social, economic, cultural, and individual factors.</p>
            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <p>The prevalence of teenage pregnancy varies widely across different regions and communities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 12 million girls aged 15-19 years and around 777,000 girls under the age of 15 give birth each year worldwide. While there have been declines in teenage pregnancy rates in some countries, it continues to be a persistent challenge in many parts of the world.</p>
            <h3>Consequences for Teenagers</h3>
            <p>Teenage pregnancy can have profound consequences for the pregnant adolescent, affecting their physical health, emotional well-being, education, and future opportunities. Physically, pregnant teenagers may face higher risks of complications during pregnancy and childbirth compared to older women. These risks include preterm birth, low birth weight, and pregnancy-related hypertension.</p>
            <p>Emotionally, teenage pregnancy can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression, as adolescents may struggle to cope with the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood while still navigating their own developmental milestones. Socially, pregnant teenagers may encounter stigma, discrimination, and isolation from peers and community members, which can further exacerbate their emotional distress and undermine their self-esteem.</p>
            <p>Educationally, teenage pregnancy is associated with higher rates of school dropout and lower educational attainment, limiting the future prospects and opportunities of young mothers. Interrupted education can perpetuate the cycle of poverty and hinder the economic empowerment of teenage mothers, making it more challenging for them to provide for themselves and their children.</p>
            <h3>Consequences for Children</h3>
            <p>In addition to the impact on teenagers themselves, teenage pregnancy also has consequences for the children born to adolescent mothers. Babies born to teenage mothers are at higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and developmental delays compared to babies born to older mothers. They may also face socioeconomic disadvantages and have fewer opportunities for optimal health, education, and well-being.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a multifaceted issue with far-reaching implications for both adolescents and their children. Addressing teenage pregnancy requires comprehensive strategies that encompass education, access to reproductive healthcare, support services, and efforts to address underlying social determinants of health. By addressing the root causes of teenage pregnancy and providing adolescents with the resources and support they need, we can empower them to make informed choices about their reproductive health and future aspirations, ultimately improving outcomes for both teenagers and their children.</p>
